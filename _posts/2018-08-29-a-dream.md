Out front. At 683. On the concrete walkway. I was searching for something not yet
clear.

I looked over to my left.

She looked at me. She smiled. Eyes slightly squinched.

She wasn't wearing glasses. She looked younger, healthy. Whole. Happy.

I reached out for the biggest hug I could muster.

The details of the dream started to fade away. Only she was in focus. I know I've
felt this way before. Lucid dreams, maybe.

>"You came to visit me!"

It was her. It was really her.

>"I know you've been doing well."

A sense of relief. All I could do was hug her more.

>"I miss you. WE ALL miss you."

With a slight pause,

>"I Know."

And all I could do was hug her.

To my wonderful Auntie Alma - forever in our hearts.

Forever in my heart.
