Martha and I had a wonderful Seattle visit! I was originally supposed to head up
for an eBay N conference, however, after I accepted the position with Zillow and
let my manager that I was leaving, I knew that my attendance at the conference
would understandably be up in the air. Considering that the company just went
threw a large round of layoffs, keeping a tight budget was going to be paramount.

Sure enough, management recommended against me going (again, understandably so).

Martha had already purchased a ticket (she was excited about heading up to Seattle
with me) which was non-refundable... so... I bought one too... and we made a great weekend
out of it!

Seattle hovered around 85F the whole weekend... a good 20 degrees warmer than
San Francisco! ðŸ˜‚

**Highlights:**

* Gas works park overlooking Lake Union and Seattle skyline
* 36mi bike ride from U-District to Woodinville
* Ramen Danbo over at Capitol Hill
* Ballard Farmers Market
* Kayaking in Puget Sound
