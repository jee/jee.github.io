Martha and I did an overnight over at Desolation Wilderness this last weekend.

It was a pretty impromptu trip that I planned. We originally wanted to do a
loop at Mammoth (Agnew Meadows -> Garnet Lake -> Thousand Island Lake -> Agnew Meadows),
however there were scattered thunderstorms forecasted the whole weekend. So we decided
to pivot and go to Desolation Wilderness.

#### Echo Lakes -> Lake Aloha

* Out and Back: ~15 mi
* Start at Echo Lakes
* End at Lake Aloha
* [Permit needed](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/Desolation-Wilderness-Permit/r/wildernessAreaDetails.do?page=details&contractCode=NRSO&parkId=72202)

There was nothing particularly tough about the distance or the weather... what we
found difficult was the terrain. This was a *rocky* trail. It almost felt like the
majority of the trail was rocky terrain. It did a number on our feet; luckily our
boots were rigid enough to support us and our packs. Unfortunately, there was also
a large fire down in the Yosemite area that filled the Tahoe Basin with smoke.

We got to Lake Aloha and set up camp. By evening, the wind was blowing eastward
and blew a lot of the smoke out of the area.

After some fine backcountry dining, we went to sleep and awoke to a lot more smoke.

We were thinking of making the hike over to Heather Lake, but once we saw all the
smoke, we decided it would probably be best to head back.

So we made the trek back and the total milage (including walking back to the car) was
closer to around 16 mi.

All in all, it was great getting out and getting our backpacking season started.
The terrain and smoke made for a tougher hike than we anticipated, but it was great
to enjoy our wonderful California.
