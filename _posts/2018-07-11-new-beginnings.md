title: New Beginnings @ Zillow

In four business days, I'll be leaving eBay's New Product Development (NPD) team and
embarking on a brand new journey with a different company... Zillow!

See, about two and a half weeks ago, I learned that Zillow wanted to move me to
their offer stage. Two days later, eBay announced some pretty large layoffs.

*The timing of the new job offer couldn't have been better.*

> While my specific team wasn't directly impacted, NPD was definitely hit. And it sucks.
Though I didn't have a direct working relationship with most of the people affected, it's
just an ugly feeling knowing that someone lost their job. My heart really goes out to those on
Visas.

With all that said, I've had a fantastic time working with the folks at NPD and
learned a ton. It was such an amazing opportunity to work with some really talented
individuals using some awesome technology. It's an experience that I'll never forget.
And after a decade of being in the workforce, I don't say that lightly.

Thanks for the wonderful memories, eBay!

### Enter Zillow
What can I say? A goal of mine entering the technology sector was to work with a company
that placed a heavy emphasis on great company culture; a company that employees *love*
working for.

A part of my job search strategy included listing and applying to top rated companies from Glassdoor
or other publications ("Top rated companies to work for!"). Zillow was almost certainly
on all those lists. Better yet, not only was I familiar with their product, but my wife
and I use it all the time!

After some hard work and a lot of studying, I'm happy to say I'm starting at Zillow
in August. Needless to say, I'm super excited!
