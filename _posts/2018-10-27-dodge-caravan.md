Ever have a song flood into your earphones that just captures you? Like, it brings
you back to a familiar place. You can see where you are. Maybe you can feel the
temperature.

This [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_98TvhaoPk) did it for me.

As soon as that first chord hits - the mixture of guitar, bass, and drums - I was
instantly thrown back in time. I was in the front seat of my dad's work van. A 1997
Dodge Caravan. White. Just a plain, cargo van. All the seats except the front
two were removed because he had to carry Xerox machine parts (he was a technician
for them for ~25+ years).

It was like we were heading to Pomona. To the computer shows
that they would hold out there at the Fairplex. We'd go, look at all the PC parts

> I'd drool over the newest graphics cards... The ol' GeForce cards... and the older
VooDoo cards with 3dFx capabilities, and MAYBE, if I was lucky, I'd come home with
a new computer game.

I could see it. Heading out on the 10 fwy. The hills are all dry and brown. It's
hot outside. And we got this song cranked up.

Except, I'd never heard of Kings X back in those days. I think they probably flew
out of my Dad's radar, too. It's a song that we never listed to, together.

It just has that quality though.

I should send the song to him. He'd probably like it!
