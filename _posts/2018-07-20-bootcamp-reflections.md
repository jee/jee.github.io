title: Reflections On A (My) Bootcamp Experience
date: 2018-07-20

Several months ago, I responded to a post on Reddit:

>Hack Reactor Grads: How Was Your Job Hunt? What Was The Outcome?

I responded and a few people DM'd me on Reddit asking about my experience at
Hack Reactor (HR).

I really love these types of questions; especially since I had so many of my own
when I was starting to seriously think about transitioning careers from a life of
Environmental Engineering into Tech. So many people have helped me along my
journey, so when someone is looking for some additional insight, I'm always happy to
help.

#### Was Hack Reactor worth it?
For me, absolutely. 100%. My goal was to get into tech... and I got into tech. Was
it solely because of HR? No. Definitely not.

I saw HR as a special opportunity to hit "pause" on my work life for a bit and
really focus on not only learning, but pivoting careers.

**Emphasis: You have to *REALLY* want to do this.**

I mean *REALLY*. Career changes aren't for the faint of heart.

#### What about the cost?
In terms of cost, my wife and I kept a pragmatic approach to looking at the
Bootcamp. What was going to be our ROI on this "investment"?

Her Graduate studies cost us about $80K, took 2-years, and yielded a 6-figure income.

My Bootcamp was going to cost us about $18K, take 3-months, and supposedly would yield
a 6-figure income.

Thankfully, we had the money saved up and my wife believed in me! This was a chance
we felt comfortable taking.

If you have the time, patience, and are fairly up to date with industry standards,
it is most definitely possible to curate your own curriculum. You'll also save yourself
$17K-18K.

#### Is it realistic to land a job with the Big Four?
Sure it is! Many have done it. Just remember,

>Computer Science Degrees are *STILL* the Gold Standard!

And,

>Your job search is *YOURS* and *YOURS* only! Don't expect Hack Reactor to land you a job!

Really though. Not one recruiter said to me "Your resume stood out because I saw
that you attended Hack Reactor." Not one.

All they cared about was the fact that I had "React" or "Angular" or "Redux" on
my resume and a list of applications with links that they could click through
and poke around with and that I sounded like a reasonable human being over the phone.

You might start as a contractor, but that in itself can be a very motivating experience!

I know folks from HR that have landed jobs with:

* LinkedIn
* Facebook
* Google
* Apple

Etc.

#### Is there an "anti-bootcamper" perception?
Maybe. If you certainly peruse Reddit and HackerNews, it definitely seems that way.

But what does it matter? Take *YOUR* job search into your own hands! Go for it!

No one in industry (recruiters or hiring managers) has given me any grief
about attending a bootcamp. Not a single person. That's not to say they didn't
have any negative bias against me. It's just that one of the the hardest parts
of job searching is getting a recruiter to go through your resume and actually
*give* you a call.

Once they do that, questions about your lack of a CS degree or Bootcamps just don't
come up... Once they decided to take the plunge and call me (i.e. they felt like
they did enough due diligence to call), they didn't seem to care. They were just
super stoked to see that I had a list of apps that I built and wanted to see what
kind of personality fit I'd be.

So, if anyone did have an anti-bootcamper perception, I never heard about it.

Probably because they never called me.

...Because they had an anti-bootcampter perception. üòÅ

#### Is it hard to make the jump over to a software engineering field with no work experience?
It took me about three and a half months to find a job. About a year, soup to nuts,
to transition from my previous field to software, however, your milage may vary.

Don't get me wrong, I thought HRs curriculum was great and I loved coding real
and practical applications. CS students go through academia, coding esoteric concepts,
which have *tremendous value*... They just tend to lack the modern,
practical knowledge used in web development (UC Davis for instance doesn't teach
JavaScript... At least back when I went there. Nor does UC San Diego).

But what CS grads lack, they easily make up by having a CS degree and being able to think
in a **methodical**, **programmatic** way... They learn languages easier. They have
that solid foundation to stand on. Granted, I don't have a CS degree and a lot of
this is anecdotal and based on a UC San Diego CS grads experience that attended
the same HR cohort as me.

At HR, you will learn how to MAKE applications. Awesome applications, undoubtedly.
But without a CS degree, the HARDEST part is getting someone to look at your
resume and send you a note that they'd like to get in touch... CS degrees get
call backs much easier than folks like me when I first started.

With that said, with persistence and practice, if you can code and display some
social intelligence, you *WILL* find a job. There are SO MANY JOBS out here, it's
really mind blowing. And the housing prices here probably have a lot to do with
that "perk" if you're in Tech!

Also - you might hear from others in the industry that it's saturated with rookie
programmers. IMO, It's all relative.

I came from an industry that had 14 people competing per job posting.

In software, it ranges from three to five people per posting.

It was a godsend in my eyes.

*(At least a year ago, Indeed used to publish some interesting job trends; most notably
the number of job seekers per job posting. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like
they share that information anymore.)*

#### Are six figure salaries common for new grads in the program?
If you're in the SF Bay Area, yes. Cost of living is high out here, though.

### Final Thoughts
If you're fortunate enough to have a great support system around (like I did), you're
going to have an easier time. Surround yourself with people that want you to be
successful. It's not an easy field to get into if you're looking to make some
easy money.

It's not easy.

If you really want it. Do it.

I've been extremely happy with my career choice.

Get to it!
